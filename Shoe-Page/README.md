This is html file. In this, I have used div, h1, p, main tags are used for dividing or creating layers of the html page. I linked css file by using link tag rel is attribute to provide file type and href is attribute to provide address of the file.

Following are some properties used:<br>

universal, class and tag are used as selectors for styling elements.<br>
margin/ padding -> for giving spaces externally or internally in an element. <br>
color -> for giving color to the text.<br>
background -> for giving linear-gradient background color in navbar. <br>
background-color -> for giving background color in containers. <br>
flex -> property of display for styling.
box-shadow, display with flex property value, position with absolute property value and transform <br> have been used for giving shadow in the container, for managing proper width of the containers, for managing position of the element <br> and for rotating the div element with an angle.
Overflow is used in body for non-scrollable body.
