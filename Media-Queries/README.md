This is index.html file. We use Link tag in head to connect css file with html file.
rel -> attribute tell about type of sheet we are calling and href -> attribute gives address of file.

universal, class, and tag selector used in css. <br>
In css styling, common properties have been used as: <br>
margin -> used for giving space between two elements.<br>
padding -> used for giving space between content and border of the element.<br>
box-sizing -> property used for styling box like container for body.<br>
color -> used for giving color of text.<br>
border -> used for giving style to border. There are many propereties for border like border-style border-radius. <br>
background properties -> used for styling backgrund like color, etc.<br>
border-radius -> cornering the element border using it.<br>
It is created using media query, in which the size of the image and the flex-direction of the main container have been fixed for small screen size. <br>
In max-screen size the flex direction is set to row-wise. <br>
In min-screen size the flex direction is set to column-wise. <br>
There is a header with white strip and the image is set to overlay on the header. <br>
Position: relative, and top: , have been used for fixing the some part of the image to the header. <br>
