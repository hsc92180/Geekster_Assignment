For styling external of css sheet is added. tag and class named selectors have been used for giving css properties to particular section.<br>
General properties used: <br>

margin/padding -> for giving external/internal spaces of a element.<br>
height/width -> for giving height and width of the boxes of elements.<br>
linear-gradient() -> creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a straight line. <br>
