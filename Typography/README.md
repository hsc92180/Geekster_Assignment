This is html file. In this, I have used div for dividing the parts in the main div whose display property is setted to flex. Inside inner-main div, I have used h2, img, p, iframes tag according to their need. I linked css file by using link tag rel is attribute to provide file type and href is attribute to provide address of the file.

### styling part

tag and class named selectors have been used for styling particular elements.<br>
margin/ padding -> for giving spaces externally or internally in an element. <br>
border -> for giving border properties.<br>
The main focus is to use flex property of display and related properties like justify-content, align-items have used for styling the outer div.
